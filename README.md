1.It is the famous snake game. You basically control arrow keys to let snake to eat apple which is randomly generated. You will fail if you
go out of the window or touch the snakes's body.

2.My codes try to keep it simple. Therefore I only include a few properties of kivy like graphic, uix. Meanwhile, I use my creativity to set up functions like
_next() to simulate the process and idea of deque from collection to best fit in with the functionality of the game.


**For more details, you can just go through my code :)**
